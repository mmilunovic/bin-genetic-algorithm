# bin-genetic-algorithm
Implementation of binary genetic algorithm for function optimization. 

Python implementation of binary genetic algorithm with two point crossover and inverse mutation. 
This was a Genetic Algorithms course project and it's set up to optimize Levy's function number 13 but can optimize any given function. 
Here is plaint python code, there is also an interactive [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-x937Ni6FRlDlOqlaeYTBm4g29FobG1u)
with explanations (in Serbian). 

Three graphics bellow represent average and best chromosome value for every generation. Algorithm runs with 20, 100 and 150 initial chromosomes, 5 times.
